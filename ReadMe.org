* What is this?
This is my texmf folder, published as a nix flake. This allows for reproducible tex documents and also means I don't need to keep track of different macro and =sty= files: =nix= and =git= take care of them for me! I have too many old documents that no longer build due to external dependencies changing, so this is a way to solve that issue.
